## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints
- Document functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

Example:
```python
from typing import Dict, Any

def analyze_data(input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze input data and return processed results.

    Args:
        input_data: Dictionary containing data to analyze

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use pytest for testing

Example:
```python
def test_analyze_data():
    """Test data analysis functionality."""
    input_data = {"test": "data"}
    result = analyze_data(input_data)
    assert "analysis" in result
    assert result["status"] == "success"
```
