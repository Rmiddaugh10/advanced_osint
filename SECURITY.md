## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the OSINT Framework seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.
2. Submit your findings through one of these channels:
   - Email our security team directly at [security@your-domain.com]
   - Open a confidential issue in our security advisory section
   - Use our private vulnerability reporting form (if available)

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide the following information in your vulnerability report:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if known)
5. Your contact information for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours.
- You can expect a more detailed response within 72 hours, assessing the issue.
- We will keep you informed about our progress in addressing the vulnerability.
- Once fixed, we will notify you and publish an advisory (if appropriate).

## Security Best Practices

When using the OSINT Framework, please follow these security guidelines:

### Authentication and Access

1. Handle all collected data according to relevant privacy laws and regulations
2. Securely store scan results and findings
3. Implement appropriate data retention policies
4. Use encryption for sensitive data storage and transmission

### Scanning Guidelines

1. Only scan targets you have explicit permission to assess
2. Respect rate limits and scanning policies
3. Implement appropriate timeouts and resource limits
4. Monitor system resource usage

### Operational Security

1. Keep the framework and all dependencies updated
2. Regularly check for security advisories
3. Monitor for unusual activity
4. Maintain secure configuration practices
